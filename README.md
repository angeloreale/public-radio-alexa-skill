# public-radio-alexa-skill

This is the sample file for an Alexa Skill meant for playing live radio streams.

It was built in Javascript for a Node.js lambda function.

I really like [Threads Radio](https://threadsradio.com) and just got an integrated sound system at home using Alexa devices. I was struggling with finding an easy way to listen to Threads live, so, being a programmer myself, decided to take some time to develop this skill for personal use. It might be published eventually, but in meanwhile, if you also have the same need, I hope this file can help you somehow.

It was built for a scenario where a radio has 2 live channels in Airtime.pro. Obviously, anything can be adapted here.

Just search for the string `YOUR_RADIO` to find places to replace.

References I used: https://github.com/alexa-samples/skill-sample-nodejs-audio-player

I hope you find this useful.
