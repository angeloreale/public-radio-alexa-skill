# public-radio-alexa

This is the sample file for an Alexa Skill meant for playing live radio streams.

It was built in Node.js for a lambda function.

I really like [Threads Radio](https://threadsradio.com) and just got an integrated sound system at home using Alexa devices. I was struggling with finding an easy way to listen to Threads live, so, being a programmer myself, decided to take some time to develop this skill for personal use. It might published eventually, but in meanwhile, if you also have the same need, I hope this file can help you somehow.

It was built off an use-case of a radio with 2 live 24h channels in Airtime.pro. Obviously, anything can be adapted here.

References I used: https://github.com/alexa-samples/skill-sample-nodejs-audio-player

I hope you find this useful.
